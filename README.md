# serverless-github-badges

This project is inspired by [puf17640/git-badges](https://github.com/puf17640/git-badges), but built with the serverless stack: Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Workers KV.

It would be cheap and easy to deploy, more important, it has better availability than the self-hosted service.
